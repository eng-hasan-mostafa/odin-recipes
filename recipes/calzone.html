            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.</li>
                <li>Add shredded chicken and onion to hot bacon grease in the pan. Cook and stir over medium heat until onion is tender. Stir in 1/3 cup barbeque sauce; remove from heat. Mix in crumbled bacon.</li>
                <li>Roll pizza crust dough onto a greased cookie sheet. Press out to an even thickness, then cut in half. Divide chicken mixture between dough pieces, spreading over 1/2 of each dough piece to within 1/2 inch of the edge.</li>
                <li>Drizzle remaining barbeque sauce over the filling. Sprinkle with cheese and cilantro. Fold uncovered portion of dough over the filling. Press the edges together with a fork to seal.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 25 minutes. Cool for a few minutes, then cut each calzone in half for 4 servings. Serve with additional barbeque sauce if desired.</li>
